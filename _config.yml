title: Oliver Bates - Research and design for equitable and sustainble futures

description: >- # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  Hey! I do a mixture of tech, facilitation, design, and research making systems and services more equitable and sustainable. 
  I have a history of working on social and environmental projects, shaping responsible and ethical services and platforms. 
  I like to use whatever methods fit the project, from data-driven to speculative design, and all mixtures inbetween.
  My work is community-led, design justice oriented, and co-operative (think co-design).
  I love working in teams and bringing critical perspectives into the mix.
