# Hi! :wave:

Hello! I am Oliver. 

Hey! I am a researcher, consultant and facilitator driving justice and sustainability in digital platforms and services. 
Leveraging my tech and data expertise I help make systems and services more equitable and sustainable.
I have a history of working on social and environmental projects, shaping responsible and ethical services and platforms.
I like to use whatever methods fit the project, from data-driven to speculative design, and all mixtures inbetween.
My work is community-led, design justice oriented, and co-operative (think co-design).
I love working in teams, seeing things others don't, and bringing critical lived experience perspectives into the mix.


I've got a background in computer science. These days I blend computing, data science, design and user research to critique digital platforms, design better services, and empower communities. I do this through consultancy with third sector and government organisations at [fractals.coop](https://fractals.coop) and through my academic research.

If you'd like to chat about my work or are interested in working together, please get in touch.
