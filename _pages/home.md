# Hi! :wave:

Hello! I am Oliver. I am a researcher, consultant and facilitator driving justice and sustainability in digital platforms and services.
I've got a background in computer science. These days I blend computing, data science, design and user research to critique digital platforms, design better services, and empower communities. I do this through consultancy with third sector and goverment organisations at [fractals.coop](https://fractals.coop) and through my academic research.

If you'd like to chat about my work or are interested in working together, please get in touch.
