# Hi! :wave:

Hello! I am Oliver. I am a researcher, consultant and facilitator driving justice and sustainability in digital platforms and services.
I've got a background in computer science, and now I'm blending computing, data science, design and user research to critique digital platforms, design better services,
and empower communities.

If you'd like to chat about my work or are interested in working together, please get in touch.

Maybe I'll move all my content here from About here and then have a CV and a Portfolio pages - and save the blog for future Oliver?
