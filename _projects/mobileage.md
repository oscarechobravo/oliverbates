We ran a series of workshops and user engagement activities in Kendal, UK to understand older adults relationships with technology and begin a blended co-creation and action-research project.

As a User Researcher I co-facilitated workshops with colleagues from Lancaster University. The activities included:
- *a show and tell session* from colleagues who had previously ran action-research design sprints
- *an open space* held for the community to share their experiences around digital technology and their needs for independent living. 

The workshop organically shifted into a technology help session with attendees asking questions about their smartphones, banking apps and tablets.

This formed part of the discovery phase of the EU funded [MobileAge](https://mobile-age.eu/) project, looking to co-create digital platforms and policy to support independent living with older adults.

## Outcomes:
- Participant recruitment for action-research and co-creation
- Initial case studies of digital technology use in the context of independent living
- Examples of where local services and rapidly evolving tech were failing to meet the needs of older adults
- Reflections on how to recruit and promote for future user research sessions
