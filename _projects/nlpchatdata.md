As part of a summer internship I was tasked with prototyping techniques to track and identify online-predators in internet forums and chat-rooms. The focus waas on utilising open source NLP modules in Java to develop a proof of concept that measured the similarity of language used by chat users in the case that they are changing their usernames.

Specific work:
- Creating chat room test data
- Feature Tree Algoritms for something... 
- Working with NLP chat data to compare chat traces to tune NLP techniques to detect similar language and phrases used by chat users.
