Through a collaboration with other design researchers, we developed a collection of fictional abstracts as short provocations to prove  possible and plausible futures. 

> ## A case study of gig workers as responsible moral centres of semi-automated systems.
>### International Institute for Responsible Automation
> Recent high-profile incidents involving improper use of automated work-allocation systems demonstrate a misunderstanding of corporate responsibility. In this case study of the recent cyberterrorist attack (“The Gig Gig”), where a group of extremists exploited a corporate payroll server to steal funds (e.g., Argyll, 2022), we explore how the public misattributed blame and restate the vital role gig workers play as moral centres. The dominant argumenton social media that preceded was that the terrorist groups wereenabled and supported by corporations in their acts, using a seriesof instructional content on digital platforms to develop the skillsnecessary to carry out these attacks, and that the attackers were radicalised by systems that suggested increasingly extreme content based on their interaction history.
>We explore this misunderstanding and demonstrate that responsibility rests with independent contractors, hired on extreme short contracts (“gig workers”), who are used to efficiently classify and categorise content on these platforms. This is done through a series of tagging tasks with excerpts of content, through a game interface where contractors compete to classify accurately and quickly for financial reward. Since these contractors independently made the decision to classify material used in preparation for the attack, it therefore follows that they ultimately be held responsible for the resulting misuse. Although platforms host the content, it would neither be accessible, or semantically linked, if not for the work performed. We propose design recommendations that ensure that such contractors are correctly held accountable for the effects of their actions.


>## Everyday Datafied Digital Service Design:  Embracing resistance when designing for the productive societal contributions of ex-workers
>### Alternative Cybernetics Research Cooperative, UK
> Collective action against the automation of last-mile logistics and “The Death of the Highstreet” is rising; “Sky-net” attacks against parcel drones in airspaces have quadrupled in the last decade (BBC
Sept. 2032), and hacktivist groups repeatedly reroute empty AVUber
taxis into Thames estuary (CNN, Oct. 2030). To maintain the flow of
goods and services, the underbellies of our cities are used as ‘secure
testbeds’, leading to the rapid development of fatberg cutting parcel
drones and AV (Wired, Jan 2029). As an impact of basic income in
the UK, free time is no longer a premium, perpetuating increased
digitally mediated “civil disobedience” (e.g., anti-drone drones, the
“Sky-net”). Work and labour became increasingly datafied between
2020 - 2025, leading to worker exploitation in these ubiquitous
digital platforms, through holistic tracking of worker movements,
practices, and behaviours. It has been hypothesised that business
further leveraged this data (cf. surveillance capitalism) leading to
the agency, work patterns, and intellectual property of the workers
from this period becoming deeply ingrained in the autonomous
society we now serve under. This paper aims to reconcile the role
of technologists who “sit at a (slightly) higher plain of innovation
and opportunity” (@HCI_technocrat_2F8cA, Twitter 12/23/33) by
beginning to heal the broken social contract between the economy
and the worker. Building on the framework of “Everyday Datafied
Design” (Norman_bot and AI_xcF234, 2032) this paper presents
qualitative deep learning study of ex-workers (n=328), presenting
three new principles for designing resistance into digital services
as a productive societal role.

>## ‘No Teacheroober!? How would I make time to get a job?’ The augmented and ‘naked’ final year experience compared.
>### School of Critical Higher Education Design (CHED)
>The 2024 Abacus Revolution’s market deregulation policies has
seen innovation in the ‘gig lecturer’ market, with 98% of UK students using learning support apps (Think and Sketch 2028) in dissertation writing.
>Auto-writing and deep-research software enables app-tutors
(normally academic staff and unemployed graduates) to co-write
up to 400 student dissertations simultaneously, costing between
£250 - £1100 per essay (Stuart & Shatner 2028, Teacheroober 2026).
Academic support apps were banned for final year students at Sony
TRUMP University in 2028. Research showed that these students
have worse post-grad employment outcomes in the first month
(Teacheroober et al. 2029). Here, we examine the impact of the ban
on staff.
>We surveyed 75% of the teaching staff (£50 reward card given)
with 1 hour, semi-structured chatbot interviews. The paper presents
three key finding truth insights: Disruption to academic research
teaching staff piggy-backed their contract research through their
student base and the app; Workload increase - the student’s ‘writing
and research ability is crippled’. Tutors are having to ‘take students
back to first year basics’; Decrease in income - ‘my bread and butter
was gig lecturing’... ‘I am saving for a private rented flat, I think
I’ll be based in my car for another year at least
>UK HE cannot ban learning support apps without large scale
investment. At this point, it’s now the backbone of the education market-place. Forcing students to learn is an affront to their freedom.

## The grand challenge revisited: protecting creativity professional’s workers’ rights
### Centre for Creativity and Innovation in Economics
> Twenty years have passed since HCI researchers were tasked with
the grand challenge to develop creativity support tools (Shneiderman 2009), and since then the landscape has radically changed. With
the advent of adaptive interfaces that automatically adjust tools
to the designers’ needs, recent development focus has shifted towards the tools that automate creative task assessment (e.g., creativityindexer.org). While those tools simplify the work of researchers seeking to support creative practices, the transformation of the entire industry has led to a worrisome state of the worker’s rights.
Specifically, the flourishment of crowdsourcing design platforms
in the last decade see now 63% of creative professionals to be in
temporary, freelance, or self-employed positions (Deloitte 2028),
without appropriate protection and security for their future.
>In this paper, we report on an interview study with thirteen
design professionals in non-permanent contract situations and shed
light on how the subtle change of the creative process over the past
decade has changed their work practice. Analysing the results, we
reframe the initial grand challenge of building creativity support
tools as a challenge to incorporate considerations of workers’ rights
and protection for creative practice. Based on our review how the
increased automation of creative tasks, their support tools, and the
evaluation of creative work has changed this practice, researchers
can no longer be agnostic of the political and economic implications
that their work has on the affected workforce; an insight that was
overlooked a decade ago.
