[Crank and File](https://crankandfile.co.uk) is a collection of research outputs offer worker-centric perspectives on gig economy courier work. The project is co-lead by myself and [Ben Kirman](https://ben.kirman.org/).

Having started development in 2019 with [Switch-Gig](https://switchgig.wordpress.com), this project has prioritised worker-led methods, producing a range of outputs that put forward the perspectives and experiences of gig economy couriers working in UK cities.

This project brings together research outputs and learnings from Switch-Gig, FlipGig, and Meal Deal.
