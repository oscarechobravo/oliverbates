Meal Deal is a card game that offers worker-centric perspectives on gig economy courier work. The project is co-lead by myself and [Ben Kirman](https://ben.kirman.org/) and is grounded in the research projects [Switch-Gig]() and [Flip Gig]().

Having started development in 2019 with [Switch-Gig](https://switchgig.wordpress.com), this project has prioritised worker-led methods, producing a range of outputs that put forward the perspectives and experiences of gig economy couriers working in UK cities.

This project brings together outputs from:
- Switch-Gig
- FlipGig
- Meal Deal
