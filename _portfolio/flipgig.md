[FlipGig](http://www.flipgig.org/) was a research project that brought together user research, transport research and operational research to consider how gig economy models in last-mile logistics can be made more fair and sustainable. I worked as the __Lead User Researcher__ (Research Co-Investigator)

The project ran for a little over 2 years. My role focused on:
- Managing the research design, research ethics, recruitment, communications and user research team
- Managing industry partnerships with Hermes (Evri), Transport for London, Miralis Data and Menzies Distribution
- Driving worker-led approaches - Co-design of research protocol with workers
- Working with couriers to understand their lived and working experiences to inform service and platform design 
- Research delivery: reports, papers, stakeholder presentations
- Web and content design for project website

### Outcomes:
- Recommendations for last-mile and gig economy courier platform and services to focus on aspects of worker experiences
- Contributions to Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) on The impact of Coronavirus on businesses and workers.
- New methods for worker-led data collection, prioritising exploring their lived experiences, and exploring data they may already gather.
- Engagement with industry over fair pay and conditions
- Feature [article in WIRED](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/gig-economy-fix-academics)
- Co-organisation of [Digital Worker Enquiry](https://digitalworkerinquiry.com/) bringing together researchers, tech and workers.
