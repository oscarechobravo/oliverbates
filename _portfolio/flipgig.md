[FlipGig](http://www.flipgig.org/) was a research project that brought together user research, transport research and operational research to consider how gig economy models in last-mile logistics can be made more fair and sustainable. I worked as the __Lead User Researcher__ (Research Co-Investigator)

The project ran for a little over 2 years. My role focused on:
- Managing the research design, research ethics, recruitment, communications and user research team
- Driving worker-led approaches - Co-design of research protocol with workers
- Working with couriers to understand their lived and working experiences to inform service and platform design 
- Research delivery: reports, papers, stakeholder presentations
- Web design for project website
