OurTravel was a project using mobile technologies to connect rural communities in the North of England. This particular prototype application was developed as part of a sprint focusing on journey sharing in contexts where public transport is absent or reduced. The module I developed fed data to the front end application in iOS that would allow users of the app to look at other user's active/planned journeys and see if there was overlap.

Using C# I developed a back-end module that took GPS data and routes for route matching. 

- Developing C# modules to test whether a traveler is on an overlapping journey
- Collection of real world GPS test data 
- Using geofencing libraries for journey matching
- Developing handles to send data to the iOS application

Using: C#, Visual Studio
