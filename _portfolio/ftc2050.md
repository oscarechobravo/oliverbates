[FlipGig](http://www.flipgig.org/) is a research project that brings together user research, transport research, operation research and HCI to consider how gig economy models in last-mile logistics can be made more fair and sustainable.

The project ran for a little over 2 years and focused on two parallel tracks:
- Working with couriers to understand their lived and working experiences to help inform technology design 
- Developing optimisations for industry applications of last mile logistics that prioritised fair pay of workers
