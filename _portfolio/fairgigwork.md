# How fair is gig work in Scotland?
## The problem
Gig economy delivery platforms such as UberEats, Deliveroo, DoorDash focus on a smooth consumer experience in their design. For workers (couriers) a small change to the interface can impact their weekly earnings. 

The needs and experiences of workers are invisible to other platform users, and the atomisation of the workforce means that engaging with stakeholders (platform, civic, community, restaurant) is almost an impossible task. Whilst couriers may collect data for their own work-based accounting, there are very few accessible tools to collate data and present work patterns to stakeholders.

It's difficult to understand how much working time gig economy couriers were being paid for, how waiting impacts their experiences of working, and how their interactions with the stakeholders and infrastructures they came into contact with during their work.

## Outcomes

- A research probe pack for collecting data to understand the experiences of workers

- New analyses toolchains for understanding paid and unpaid work.

- A series of case studies articulating the lived-experiences of couriers.

## My role
I led the team through the overall design of the research and supported the delivery. This included desk research on food delivery apps and the interfaces that couriers use, developing bespoke research protocol and adapting existing methods, getting feedback from couriers on the methods, and then testing the research methods in the work environment. I supported the data collection and interview phases. I led on the quantative and geospatial analysis of the research data. 

## Results and impact


## Main Challenges and lessons learned

## Next steps

desk research on what's in the app

spoke to a handful of couriers to test our data gathering methodology

did a thing with 8 couriers for a working week in Edinburgh

developed a methods pack
