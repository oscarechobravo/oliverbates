[Crank and File](https://crankandfile.co.uk) is a collection of research outputs offer worker-centric perspectives on gig economy courier work. The project is co-lead by myself and [Ben Kirman]().

Having started development in 2019 with [Switch-Gig](https://switchgig.wordpress.com), this project has continued to develop!
