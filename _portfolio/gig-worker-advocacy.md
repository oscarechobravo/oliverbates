Supporting gig worker advocacy by designing bespoke engagement tools. We developed a set of bespoke design probes (including maps, diaries, and photos) to understand the experiences of gig economy workers (who work for food platforms such as Deliveroo and UberEats). 

We then used this research data to develop a toolkit for couriers to collect and analyse their own data to better communicate their experiences to public officials and policymakers focusing on digital strategies around cities and work.

*As part of the [Switch-Gig](https://switchgig.wordpress.com/) we were looking at methods and tools for capturing the experiences and expertise of gig economy couriers.*
